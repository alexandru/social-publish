 Preamble

 The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
 cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

 The GNU General Public License (GPL) and the Affero General Public
 License (AGPL) are both copyleft licenses, but the AGPL has an
 additional requirement: if you run a modified program on a server and
 let other users interact with it there, your server must also allow them
 to download the source code of the modified version. The intent is to
 ensure that improvements made to network server software are shared with
 the community.
