# CLI wrapper for running social-publish commands with minimal logging
# This script wraps the java-exec command and sets up logging for CLI usage.
# 
# Usage: ./cli <command> [options]
# Example: ./cli create-user --db-path /var/lib/social-publish/sqlite3.db

# Run the app with minimal logging (warnings and errors only)
# Use --verbose flag on individual commands to see more logging
exec /opt/app/java-exec -jar /opt/app/app.jar "$@"
